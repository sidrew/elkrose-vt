# VT SMALL-TALK RESPONSE DATA
#
# Data for the dialog response engine (00_vt_dialog_engine.rpy / VT-Dialog-Response-System.md).
# DATA ONLY -- no control flow. Each entry: optional `when` conditions, optional `priority`,
# and a `lines` dict in vt_voice's register->variants shape. Omitted axes = "don't care";
# approach-specific entries out-specify the bare fallback, reproducing the old elif chain.
#
# Migration is behaviour-preserving: lines are lifted verbatim from the live trees in
# vt_small_talk_pregnancy.rpy. The live trees are NOT yet wired to call this -- that's a later phase.
#
# SEEDED SO FAR:
#   vaginal_condom_pref -- COMPLETE (68 entries): by_player, by_other, wants-condom, prefers-bare.
#   anal_condom_pref    -- COMPLETE (78 entries): general 39 [by_player(13, register-rich) +
#                          wants(13) + prefers-bare(13)] + anal-virgin overlay 39 [same shape,
#                          anal_virgin:True]. No parent/desire/pill (vaginal) axes -- anal = no preg
#                          risk. wants/prefers gated pregnancy in {none, by_other} (no anal by-other
#                          case). Virgin entries out-specify their general sibling by 1 condition ->
#                          win for anal virgins; general 39 are the experienced path, untouched.
#                          Virgin tone = RELUCTANCE ("gross/weird at first"), carried by the register
#                          ladder (demure/shy squeamish -> direct/crude reluctant-but-curious).
#   oral_condom_pref    -- COMPLETE (39 entries): by_player(13, register-rich) + wants(13) +
#                          prefers-bare(13). Same shape as anal; NO oral-virgin overlay (a first
#                          blowjob lacks anal's trepidation charge). Gated as anal.
#   bc_methods          -- COMPLETE (16 entries, register-rich): how she frames her CURRENT bc status.
#                          Branches birth_control x desire_tier x parent_broad x virgin x
#                          wants_vaginal_condom -- NO approach/role/pregnancy (the live `_bc_line`
#                          reads none of those). 2x3 grid: HIGH splits parent->virgin; ON-pill MID/LOW
#                          no sub-split; NOT-pill MID/LOW split virgin x wants (2x2). desire_tier per
#                          the engine fact (mid=30-70), matching the vaginal prefers-bare convention.
#   body_condom_pref    -- COMPLETE (13 entries, neutral-only): the 4th protection-menu sibling.
#                          approach x role (12) + one empty-when role-agnostic fallback for approaches
#                          outside the four known ones. External ejaculation = no preg risk, so no
#                          pregnancy/desire/virgin axes. Single-line source -> neutral-only.
#   pregnancy_feelings_supportive -- item 1 of the pregnancy-feelings menu ("This is a beautiful time
#                          in your life...", live ~3747-3885). PURE-LINE branches migrated (27 entries,
#                          neutral-only): compassionate/sexualized/dominate x desire_tier x role. The
#                          `transactional` approach embeds cash sub-menus -> stays in the label for now.
#                          pregnancy in {by_player, by_other} (the label's knows-pregnant gate).
#   pregnancy_feelings_fetish -- item 2 ("I love the idea of you carrying my child...", live ~3888-3959).
#                          PURE-LINE branches migrated (9 entries, neutral-only): compassionate/
#                          sexualized/dominate x role (no desire_tier -- only transactional splits, >50).
#                          transactional (cash sub-menu + role-split disgust else) AND the trailing else
#                          (unknown approach disgust line) stay in the label; no empty-when fallback here
#                          (it would misroute transactional's role-split disgust text).
# TODO (next): pregnancy-feelings items 3-5 (practical/nurturing[mother]/school[student]) +
#   the prenatal-vitamins beat; each leaves its transactional cash sub-menus in the label.
# REWORDED (2026-07-09) to fit the EXPERIENCED path -- the general (non-virgin) entries baked in
#   first-timer language that only the anal-virgin overlay should carry: general sexualized/student/
#   prefers-bare in BOTH anal (:852) and oral (:1437) said "I've never..." (now "nothing between us,
#   that sounds so exciting!"); anal compassionate/student/wants (:792) said "I'm nervous about anal...
#   I've heard it can be risky" (now "I'm always careful about anal... I know it can be risky without it").
#   These 3 table lines now DIVERGE (intentionally) from their live counterparts (live 2520/2861/2480,
#   still un-reworded) -- the fix lands for players when Phase-2 rewiring points the live tree at vt_say.
#
# VALIDATED: exec + matcher sweep over 720 not-pregnant states -> exactly 1 winner each (no ties);
# cross-state isolation holds (pregnant+wants_condom routes to by_player, not wants-condom).

    # register ladder carries distaste-warming-to-willingness (demure/shy = squeamish, needs
    # reassurance; direct/crude = reluctant-but-curious, "sounds gross, but..."). Fact: anal_virgin
    # (anal_sex_count<=0). These carry anal_virgin:True, so they out-specify their general sibling
    # by one condition and win for virgins; the general 39 stay the experienced path untouched.
    # Role note: a base-mother anal-virgin is experienced as a mother but NOT back there -- never
    # claim "experienced" at anal here. One virgin variant per approach/role/sub-block + fallbacks.

    #   * NOT-pill MID/LOW split virgin x wants_vaginal_condom (2x2), as the live nested ifs.
    # No parent branch in MID/LOW (the live tree only checks _bc_parent in the HIGH tier), so a
    # parent there is non-virgin and falls to the `virgin: False` entries -- behaviour-preserving.
